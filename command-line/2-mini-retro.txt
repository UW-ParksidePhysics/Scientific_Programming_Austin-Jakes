What Went Well
--- I learned some new commands such as 'vi' opening a new file and 'cat' to view the file contents. 


What Would Make Next Time 1% Better
---
* Focus:I am able to learn by doing

* Communication:It would be difficult to explain to someone what I am doing.

* Pacing:I am rather slow at typing

* Division of responsibility:I slowly but surly completed the assignment

* Code quality: My code is not accurate
